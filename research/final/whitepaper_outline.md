## 2. Background and Motivation
*   2.1. Language Construct Modeling (LCM)
    *   2.1.1. Core Concepts and Principles: Definition as a modeling language, focus on form-meaning pairings (constructions), semantic primitives, prompt-layered semantic control, Meta Prompt Layering (MPL), computationally grounded semantics. (Ref: `annotated_bibliography_lcm_ai_teams.md` - Resources 1, 5, 9, 11; `glossary_lcm_ai_teams.md`)
    *   2.1.2. Strengths: Semantic precision, enhanced control over LLM behavior, modularity, potential for improved explainability.
    *   2.1.3. Current Applications and Limitations (as per literature).
*   2.2. Structured AI Teams (File-Based)
    *   2.2.1. Core Concepts and Architectures: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), file-based configuration of agent personas, roles, tasks, and workflows, communication protocols. (Ref: `annotated_bibliography_lcm_ai_teams.md` - Resources 2, 4, 6, 10; `glossary_lcm_ai_teams.md`)
    *   2.2.2. Strengths: Transparency, manageability through explicit configurations, potential for task decomposition and specialized agents.
    *   2.2.3. Current Approaches and Limitations: Challenges in semantic consistency, adaptability, and deep inter-agent understanding.
*   2.3. The Need for Integration: Bridging Semantics and Structure
    *   2.3.1. Synergies: How LCM's semantic depth can enhance the operational capabilities of structured AI teams.
    *   2.3.2. Addressing Limitations: How integration can overcome challenges inherent in each approach when used in isolation. (Ref: `compatibility_matrix_lcm_ai_teams.md` - Introduction, Summary of Key Findings)
    *   2.3.3. Vision: Creating AI teams that are both operationally robust and semantically intelligent.

## 3. Proposed Integrated Framework: LCM-Enhanced AI Teams
*   3.1. Conceptual Overview: A multi-layered system where LCM provides the semantic foundation for file-configured AI teams. (Ref: `core_architecture_design.md` - Sec 4, Architectural Overview)
*   3.2. Key Principles of the Integrated Framework: Separation of concerns, modularity, interoperability, file-based configuration with semantic enrichment, layered design. (Ref: `core_architecture_design.md` - Sec 3, Key Architectural Principles)
*   3.3. Benefits of Integration: Enhanced semantic precision, dynamic adaptability, improved collaboration, traceability, explainability, modularity, and extensibility. (Ref: `core_architecture_design.md` - Sec 2, Architectural Goals; `compatibility_matrix_lcm_ai_teams.md`)

## 4. Core Architecture of the Integrated Framework
*   4.1. Architectural Components (Ref: `core_architecture_design.md` - Sec 5, Core Components)
    *   4.1.1. Semantic Layer (LCM Engine & Resources: ontologies, primitives, construction grammars)
    *   4.1.2. Team Definition & Configuration Layer (File System: agent personas, team structures, task definitions, workflow scripts, LCM configurations, knowledge schemas)
    *   4.1.3. Integration & Orchestration Layer (Mediator: loads configurations, enriches with LCM, translates insights, orchestrates tasks, manages communication)
    *   4.1.4. Execution & Operational Layer (AI Agents: perform tasks, communicate, interact with external systems)
    *   4.1.5. Shared Knowledge Repository (Persistent, versioned, semantically indexed store)
    *   4.1.6. Communication Bus (Infrastructure for message exchange)
*   4.2. Key Interactions and Data Flows (Ref: `core_architecture_design.md` - Sec 6, Key Interactions and Data Flows)
    *   4.2.1. Initialization Process (Loading configurations, semantic enrichment, agent instantiation)
    *   4.2.2. Task Assignment & Execution (Semantic interpretation of tasks, agent assignment, execution, results reporting)
    *   4.2.3. Knowledge Sharing & Learning (Contribution to SKR, semantic indexing, collective learning)
