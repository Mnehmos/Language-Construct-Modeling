# Architect Mode Activity Log: Task T3.1 - Architecture Diagram Specification

## 1. Action Summary
This log details the process of creating the `architecture_diagram_specification.md` document. The primary goal was to define a visual representation of the integrated LCM and Structured AI Teams framework based on existing architectural documentation.

## 2. Process Steps
1.  **Task Understanding:** Reviewed the requirements for Task T3.1, focusing on the expected output: `architecture_diagram_specification.md` and this log file.
2.  **Context Gathering (Attempt 1 - Memory Agent):**
    *   Attempted to query `memory-agent-sql` for relevant context using `related_task_id`.
    *   Result: Error due to non-existent column `related_task_id`.
3.  **Context Gathering (Attempt 2 - Memory Agent Schema):**
    *   Queried `memory-agent-sql` for the schema of `memory_entries` table using `get_table_info`.
    *   Result: Successfully retrieved table schema.
4.  **Context Gathering (Attempt 3 - Memory Agent Corrected Query):**
    *   Queried `memory-agent-sql` again, using `metadata` and `content` columns for filtering.
    *   Result: Retrieved relevant entries, including one referencing `core_architecture_design.md`.
5.  **Document Review - Core Architecture:**
    *   Read `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/design/context/core_architecture_design.md`.
    *   Focused on Section 4 (Architectural Overview / Conceptual Diagram Description), Section 5 (Core Components), and Section 6 (Key Interactions and Data Flows) to identify key visual elements and relationships.
6.  **Document Review - Technical Foundation Draft:**
    *   Read `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/implementation/docs/draft_technical_foundation.md`, specifically Section 4 (Core Architecture of the Integrated Framework) and its subsections (4.1 Architectural Components, 4.2 Key Interactions and Data Flows, 4.3 Conceptual Architecture Diagram (Descriptive Text)).
    *   This provided further textual descriptions and emphasis on how the architecture is presented.
7.  **Diagram Specification Design:**
    *   Synthesized information from the reviewed documents.
    *   Defined key elements for visualization: Semantic Layer, Team Definition & Configuration Layer, Integration & Orchestration Layer, Execution & Operational Layer, Shared Knowledge Repository, Communication Bus, and External Interfaces.
    *   Determined a "Layered block diagram" style.
    *   Outlined the layout, positioning of components, and their visual characteristics (shape, color, labels, sub-text).
    *   Detailed the connections (arrows/lines) between components, including labels for clarity.
    *   Suggested appropriate diagramming tools (draw.io, Lucidchart, Visio, PlantUML) and output formats (PNG, SVG).
    *   Added notes for the diagram creator to ensure clarity and professionalism.
8.  **Output File Creation - Specification Document:**
    *   Authored the `architecture_diagram_specification.md` file according to the designed specification and task requirements.
    *   Stored the file in `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/design/containers/`.
9.  **Output File Creation - Log Document:**
    *   Authored this log file (`T3.1_architecture_diagram_spec_log.md`).
    *   Stored the file in `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/.roo/logs/architect/`.

## 3. File Paths Affected
*   **Created:** `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/design/containers/architecture_diagram_specification.md`
*   **Created:** `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/.roo/logs/architect/T3.1_architecture_diagram_spec_log.md`
*   **Read:** `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/design/context/core_architecture_design.md`
*   **Read:** `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/implementation/docs/draft_technical_foundation.md`

## 4. Schema or Pattern Impact
*   This task involved defining the visual representation of the existing architectural schema. No direct changes were made to the core architectural schema itself, but the specification provides a blueprint for its visualization.
*   The chosen diagram style (layered block diagram) is a common pattern for representing software architectures.

## 5. Related Task or Feature
*   Directly supports Task T3.1: Architecture Diagram Creation.
*   Builds upon Task T1.1: Core Architecture Design.
*   Builds upon Task T2.3: Draft Technical Foundation.
*   Will serve as input for future tasks involving the actual creation of the diagram image.

## 6. Rationale for Design Decisions
*   **Layered Approach:** Chosen to clearly delineate the different levels of abstraction and responsibility within the framework, as described in `core_architecture_design.md`.
*   **Component Grouping:** Components were grouped logically based on their function and interaction patterns.
*   **Color Coding and Shapes:** Suggested to enhance visual distinction between different types of components and layers.
*   **Connection Labels:** Included to make the data and control flows explicit and understandable.
*   **Tool and Format Suggestions:** Provided to offer flexibility and common industry practices for the actual diagram creation.

## 7. Before/After State
*   **Before:** No formal specification for the architecture diagram existed. Architectural details were primarily in textual form within `core_architecture_design.md` and `draft_technical_foundation.md`.
*   **After:** A detailed `architecture_diagram_specification.md` document is now available, providing a clear blueprint for creating the visual diagram.

## 8. Review Status
*   This specification is currently a DRAFT. It is ready for review by the Orchestrator or other relevant stakeholders.
