### Related Task or Feature
*   T1.3: Implementation Patterns - Integrated LCM & AI Teams

## 2025-05-18 22:32 MST (Update 4)

### Action Summary
*   Identified 5 key integration points for developing implementation patterns, based on `core_architecture_design.md` and `compatibility_matrix_lcm_ai_teams.md`:
    1.  **Semantically Enriching Agent Personas:** Linking persona files to LCM definitions for precise capability specification.
    2.  **LCM-Driven Task Interpretation and Decomposition:** Using LCM to understand and break down file-defined tasks.
    3.  **Semantically Grounded Inter-Agent Communication:** Ensuring message content is tied to LCM constructs, potentially using Semantic Channel Equalization.
    4.  **LCM-Enhanced Shared Knowledge Repository Interaction:** Querying and contributing to a semantically indexed knowledge store.
    5.  **Dynamic Workflow Orchestration with Semantic Awareness:** Using LCM to understand task dependencies in file-based workflows for adaptive execution.

### Action Summary
*   Developed and added Pattern 4 ("LCM-Enhanced Shared Knowledge Repository Interaction") to `implementation_patterns_guide.md`.
*   This pattern describes how the Shared Knowledge Repository can use LCM-defined schemas for storing information, how new contributions are semantically indexed by the LCM Engine, and how agents can perform LCM-powered semantic queries.
*   Included conceptual YAML for a knowledge item schema and pseudo-Python for SKR service interactions (add and query knowledge).

*   This pattern details how the Integration & Orchestration Layer can use the Semantic Layer to understand semantic dependencies between tasks in a file-based workflow, enabling context-aware path selection and dynamic (re-)prioritization.
*   Included conceptual YAML for a workflow definition and pseudo-Python for Orchestrator logic.
*   Added a "Conclusion" section to `implementation_patterns_guide.md`.
*   The `implementation_patterns_guide.md` is now complete with 5 patterns.
