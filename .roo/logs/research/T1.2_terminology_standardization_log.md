# Log: Terminology Standardization for Integrated LCM and Structured AI Teams

## 1. Process Overview
This log details the process of identifying, defining, and organizing terms for the glossary related to integrating Language Construct Modeling (LCM) and Structured AI Teams.

## 2. Phase 1: Document Review and Initial Term Extraction (2025-05-18)

### 2.1. Sources Consulted:
*   `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/research/raw/annotated_bibliography_lcm_ai_teams.md`
*   `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/research/synthesis/compatibility_matrix_lcm_ai_teams.md`
*   `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/design/context/core_architecture_design.md`
*   Memory agent query results (Timestamp: 2025-05-18 22:26:51 PM)
*   User prompt for Task T1.2 (for example definitions and structure)

### 2.2. Initial Term Identification:
An initial list of candidate terms was compiled based on a thorough review of the above documents. Terms were categorized into LCM-specific, Structured AI Team-specific, and Integrated Framework-specific.

## 3. Phase 2: Term Definition, Compilation, and Review (2025-05-18)

### 3.1. Definition Process:
Each identified term was defined by synthesizing information from the consulted sources. The origin (LCM, Structured AI Teams, Integrated Framework) and primary source document sections were noted for each term within the glossary itself.

Key considerations during definition:
*   Respecting original meanings within LCM or AI team frameworks.
*   Clearly articulating how integrated terms bridge concepts.
*   Ensuring definitions are concise yet precise for the whitepaper's audience.

### 3.2. Glossary Compilation:
All defined terms were compiled into `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/design/components/glossary_lcm_ai_teams.md`, organized alphabetically.

### 3.3. Hallucination Check / Definition Verification (2025-05-18):
A thorough review of all definitions in the generated glossary was conducted against the primary source documents:
*   `annotated_bibliography_lcm_ai_teams.md`
*   `compatibility_matrix_lcm_ai_teams.md`
*   `core_architecture_design.md`
*   Memory agent results and user prompt examples.

**Findings:**
*   The vast majority of definitions are directly supported by explicit statements or clear implications within the source materials.
*   "Contextual Graph (LCM)": Definition primarily based on user prompt example, but aligns with general LCM principles and "knowledge graph" concepts in `core_architecture_design.md`.
*   "Semantic Gateway (Integrated Framework)": Definition based on an implied component in `core_architecture_design.md` (Sec 6).
*   All other definitions were found to be well-grounded in the provided documentation. The source annotations within the glossary file itself provide traceability.

## 4. Final Output
*   Glossary: `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/design/components/glossary_lcm_ai_teams.md`
*   Log File: `projects/Whitepaper_Integrating_AI_Teams_LCM/.roo/logs/research/T1.2_terminology_standardization_log.md`
