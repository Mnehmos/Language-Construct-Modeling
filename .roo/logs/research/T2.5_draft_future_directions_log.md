# Log - Draft Future Directions Section

## Brainstorming and Drafting Process
- Reviewed the whitepaper outline (Section 8) to identify key subtopics for future directions and research opportunities.
- Examined related documents including core architecture design, compatibility matrix, and annotated bibliography to extract insights on advancements in LCM and AI team structures.
- Identified four primary focal areas:
  - Advancements in LCM for Team Contexts: Refining LCM constructs for dynamic team interactions, trust modeling, and semantic adaptability.
  - Evolution of AI Team Structures: Exploring dynamic, self-organizing team architectures and adaptive role allocation.
  - Tooling and Standardization: The need for specialized IDEs, debugging supports, and standardized LCM construct exchange formats.
  - Specific Research Questions: Proposing concrete questions regarding LCM optimization, real-time self-organization, performance metrics, and ethical frameworks.
- Ensured the drafted content maintains a forward-looking, visionary perspective grounded in practical challenges and opportunities.
- Documented references and insights to guide further revisions and integration with other whitepaper sections.
