    *   **Rationale for selection in bibliography:** Added to bibliography due to user highlighting the URL. The post describes a multi-agent framework for Roo Code, focusing on a structured, transparent, and self-delegating AI team. This provides a practical example relevant to "structured AI teams."
*   **Query 5 (User-provided URL):** `site:github.com chonghin33 lcm-1.13-whitepaper` (prompted by user providing `https://github.com/chonghin33/lcm-1.13-whitepaper`)
    *   **Key finding:** Identified the "Language Construct Modeling (LCM) v1.13 White Paper" by Vincent Shing Hin Chong. This is a primary source for LCM. (Selected)

## Rationale for Source Selection (Ongoing)

*   **2306.02819v1 ("Enhancing Language Representation...")**: Selected because it directly addresses enriching language representation with "constructional information," which is highly relevant to understanding how Language Construct Modeling might define and utilize semantic units for AI agent comprehension and communication. Its focus on moving beyond lexico-semantic information aligns with the potential depth of LCM.
*   **Reddit Post ("The Ultimate Roo Code Hack...")**: Selected due to user prompt and its direct relevance as a practitioner's account of building a structured, delegating AI team. Offers insights into practical challenges and desired qualities like transparency and documentation for AI team collaboration.
*   **2405.17924v1 ("Generative AI Enhances Team Performance...")**: Selected for its empirical data on AI-augmented team performance. Provides insights into effective AI integration strategies (e.g., centralized use) relevant to designing structured AI teams.
*   **2504.05755v2 ("Unraveling Human-AI Teaming...")**: Chosen for its comprehensive review of human-AI teaming and its proposed research outlook. Directly informs the design of structured AI teams by highlighting key aspects like coordination, shared mental models, and trust.
*   **1111.0041v1 ("On the Formal Semantics of Speech-Act Based Communication...")**: Included for its foundational work on providing formal, computationally grounded semantics for agent communication languages. This is vital for defining how LCM constructs translate to unambiguous inter-agent messages.
*   **Innobu ("Exploring Multi-Agent Collaboration...")**: Selected for its industry perspective on multi-agent collaboration, task decomposition, and emerging frameworks, relevant to practical aspects of structured AI teams.
*   **2308.03789v1 ("Semantic Channel Equalizer...")**: Chosen for its direct approach to modeling and mitigating language/semantic mismatch in multi-agent communication. The "semantic channel equalizer" concept is highly relevant to ensuring LCM can facilitate clear understanding among diverse AI team members.
*   **2108.05681v2 ("Semantics-Native Communication...")**: Included for its model of "semantics-native communication" and contextual reasoning. This offers a sophisticated approach for LCM to enable adaptive and effective communication within AI teams by allowing agents to tailor semantic representations.
*   **Wikipedia ("Modeling language")**: Selected for its general, foundational definition of modeling languages, providing context for LCM.
*   **Aisera Blog ("Multi Agent Systems Explained")**: Chosen for its clear explanation of MAS, relevant to defining structured AI teams.
*   **Chong, V. S. H. ("Language Construct Modeling (LCM) v1.13 White Paper")**: Added as a primary source for LCM, identified via a user-provided URL. This whitepaper defines LCM as a framework for prompt-layered semantic control in LLMs and modular prompt orchestration, which is central to the research.
