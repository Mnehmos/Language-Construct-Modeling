# Process Flow Illustrations Specification

## 1. Introduction
This document specifies the design for three key process flow diagrams illustrating the operational dynamics of the integrated Language Construct Modeling (LCM) and structured AI team framework. These flows are derived from the core architecture, implementation patterns, and identified use cases to highlight the unique benefits of the integration.

## 2. Process Flow 1: Semantically Enriched Task Assignment and Execution

*   **Purpose:** To illustrate how a task defined in a file is semantically enriched by the LCM Engine, assigned to an appropriate LCM-aware agent, executed with potential LCM-driven decomposition, and how results are processed. This flow highlights Pattern 2: LCM-Driven Task Interpretation and Decomposition.
*   **Diagram Style:** Flowchart or Activity Diagram.
*   **Key Actors/Components Involved:** User/External System, Team Definition & Configuration Layer (File System), Integration & Orchestration Layer, Semantic Layer (LCM Engine), LCM-Aware Agent(s), Shared Knowledge Repository, Communication Bus.

### Steps:
1.  **Start: Task Request Initiated** (e.g., User submits via UI, external system triggers, or internal workflow references a Task ID in a definition file).
    *   Visual: Oval (Start). Data: Task Request (containing Task ID or raw task details).
2.  **Team Definition & Configuration Layer: Retrieve Task Definition File.** (If Task ID provided).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Task Definition File (e.g., YAML).
3.  **Integration & Orchestration Layer: Receive Task Definition/Request.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
4.  **Integration & Orchestration Layer: Query Semantic Layer (LCM Engine) for Task Interpretation & Enrichment.** (Passes task description and `lcm_task_construct_id` from definition file).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Task Description, `lcm_task_construct_id`. Arrow to Semantic Layer.
5.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Interpret Task, Resolve LCM Constructs, Extract Parameters, Validate, and Potentially Decompose.** (Uses referenced LCM task construct to parse description, identify parameters, validate against schema, and if defined in construct, propose sub-tasks).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Enriched Task Semantics (structured parameters, constraints, potential sub-tasks with their own LCM constructs). Arrow back to Integration & Orchestration Layer.
6.  **Integration & Orchestration Layer: Identify Suitable LCM-Aware Agent(s).** (Compares enriched task requirements against agent semantic profiles from Team Definition Layer, potentially querying Knowledge Repository for dynamic capabilities or availability).
    *   Visual: Diamond (Decision, if multiple agents/strategies possible based on decomposition) or Rectangle (Process).
7.  **Integration & Orchestration Layer: Assign Enriched Task(s) to Selected Agent(s) via Communication Bus.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Enriched Task(s).
8.  **LCM-Aware Agent: Receive and Interpret Enriched Task using its LCM capabilities and Semantic Layer.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
9.  **LCM-Aware Agent: Execute Task.** (May involve querying Shared Knowledge Repository via Semantic Layer, interacting with External Tools via Orchestration Layer, or communicating with other agents for sub-tasks).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Sub-processes for SKR query or tool interaction can be shown.
10. **LCM-Aware Agent: Report Result/Status via Communication Bus.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Task Result/Status (potentially structured according to an LCM output construct).
11. **Integration & Orchestration Layer: Process Result.** (May involve updating workflow state).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
12. **Integration & Orchestration Layer: Update Shared Knowledge Repository (if applicable, via Semantic Layer for indexing).**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Task Result for SKR. Arrow to Semantic Layer then to SKR.
13. **End: Result Presented to User / System State Updated / Next Workflow Step Triggered.**
    *   Visual: Oval (End).

## 3. Process Flow 2: LCM-Enhanced Knowledge Repository Interaction (Query and Contribution)

*   **Purpose:** To illustrate how an LCM-Aware Agent queries the Shared Knowledge Repository (SKR) using semantic search capabilities and how new knowledge is contributed and semantically indexed. This flow highlights Pattern 4: LCM-Enhanced Shared Knowledge Repository Interaction.
*   **Diagram Style:** Flowchart or Sequence Diagram.
*   **Key Actors/Components Involved:** LCM-Aware Agent, Integration & Orchestration Layer (optional, for brokering), Semantic Layer (LCM Engine), Shared Knowledge Repository.

### Steps (Querying):
1.  **Start: Agent Needs Information.**
    *   Visual: Oval (Start).
2.  **LCM-Aware Agent: Formulate Query.** (Can be natural language or a structured query with LCM construct references, e.g., `lcm_query_construct`).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Query.
3.  **LCM-Aware Agent: Send Query to Semantic Layer (possibly via Orchestration Layer).**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Arrow to Semantic Layer.
4.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Interpret Query Semantically.** (Uses agent's LCM profile for context, resolves LCM constructs in query, understands intent).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
5.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Translate Semantic Query to Database-Specific Query for SKR.** (e.g., SPARQL, complex document query).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
6.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Execute Query against Shared Knowledge Repository.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Arrow to SKR.
7.  **Shared Knowledge Repository: Return Raw Results.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Raw Results. Arrow back to Semantic Layer.
8.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Refine, Rank, and Contextualize Results.** (Based on original semantic query and agent profile).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
9.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Return Processed Results to LCM-Aware Agent (possibly via Orchestration Layer).**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Processed Information. Arrow to Agent.
10. **LCM-Aware Agent: Utilize Information.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
11. **End: Information Utilized.**
    *   Visual: Oval (End).

### Steps (Contributing):
1.  **Start: Agent Has New Knowledge to Contribute.**
    *   Visual: Oval (Start).
2.  **LCM-Aware Agent: Prepare Knowledge Item.** (Data structured according to a relevant LCM knowledge schema, e.g., `lcm://schemas/knowledge/research_finding_v1.2`).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Knowledge Item, `schema_id`.
3.  **LCM-Aware Agent: Send Knowledge Item to Semantic Layer for Contribution (possibly via Orchestration Layer).**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Arrow to Semantic Layer.
4.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Receive Knowledge Item and its Schema ID.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
5.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Validate Item against LCM Schema.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
6.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Process Item for Semantic Indexing.** (Extracts entities, relationships, links to ontologies based on `lcm_meaning_extraction_rules` in the schema).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Semantic Metadata.
7.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Store Processed Item and Semantic Metadata in Shared Knowledge Repository.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Arrow to SKR.
8.  **Shared Knowledge Repository: Confirm Storage.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Arrow back to Semantic Layer.
9.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Notify Agent of Successful Contribution (possibly via Orchestration Layer).**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Arrow to Agent.
10. **End: Knowledge Contributed and Indexed.**
    *   Visual: Oval (End).

## 4. Process Flow 3: Semantically Grounded Inter-Agent Communication with Optional Equalization

*   **Purpose:** To illustrate how two LCM-Aware Agents communicate, how messages are semantically grounded using LCM constructs, and how the Semantic Layer can optionally perform "semantic channel equalization" if agents have different LCM profiles. This flow highlights Pattern 3: Semantically Grounded Inter-Agent Communication.
*   **Diagram Style:** Sequence Diagram or Flowchart.
*   **Key Actors/Components Involved:** Sender Agent (LCM-Aware), Receiver Agent (LCM-Aware), Communication Bus, Integration & Orchestration Layer (acting as Semantic Gateway), Semantic Layer (LCM Engine).

### Steps:
1.  **Start: Sender Agent Intends to Communicate.**
    *   Visual: Oval (Start).
2.  **Sender Agent: Formulate Message using its LCM Profile and Semantic Layer.** (Selects an `lcm_intent_construct_id`, structures payload according to construct's schema).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Message with LCM metadata (`lcm_intent_construct_id`, `lcm_sender_profile_ref`, `lcm_receiver_profile_ref`, payload).
3.  **Sender Agent: Send Message via Communication Bus.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Arrow to Communication Bus.
4.  **Communication Bus: Transmit Message.**
    *   Visual: Line/Channel.
5.  **Integration & Orchestration Layer (Semantic Gateway): Intercept Message (Optional).** (Checks `lcm_sender_profile_ref` and `lcm_receiver_profile_ref`).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
6.  **Decision: Is Semantic Equalization Needed?** (Based on profile differences or explicit flags).
    *   Visual: Diamond (Decision).
7.  **If Yes (Equalization Needed):**
    *   a.  **Integration & Orchestration Layer: Forward Message to Semantic Layer for Equalization.**
        *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Arrow to Semantic Layer.
    *   b.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Perform Semantic Channel Equalization.** (Loads sender/receiver profiles, intent construct. Transforms message payload/structure to align with receiver's profile while preserving intent).
        *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Data: Equalized Message.
    *   c.  **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine): Return Equalized Message to Integration & Orchestration Layer.**
        *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Arrow back to Integration & Orchestration Layer.
    *   d.  **Integration & Orchestration Layer: Forward Equalized Message to Receiver Agent via Communication Bus.**
        *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Arrow to Communication Bus.
8.  **If No (Equalization Not Needed):**
    *   a.  **Integration & Orchestration Layer (or Bus directly): Forward Original Message to Receiver Agent via Communication Bus.**
        *   Visual: Rectangle (Process). Arrow to Communication Bus.
9.  **Communication Bus: Deliver Message to Receiver Agent.**
    *   Visual: Line/Channel.
10. **Receiver Agent: Receive Message.**
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
11. **Receiver Agent: Interpret Message using its LCM Profile and Semantic Layer.** (Uses `lcm_intent_construct_id` and its own profile to understand the (potentially equalized) message).
    *   Visual: Rectangle (Process).
12. **End: Message Interpreted and Understood.**
    *   Visual: Oval (End).

## 5. Suggested Tools and Format (General for all flows)
*   **Tools:** Lucidchart, draw.io (diagrams.net), PlantUML (especially for sequence diagrams), Microsoft Visio.
*   **Format:** PNG (for embedding), SVG (for scalability).
*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   Use standard flowchart shapes: Ovals for Start/End, Rectangles for Processes/Activities, Diamonds for Decisions.
    *   Use standard sequence diagram elements if that style is chosen.
    *   Clearly label all components, data objects, and connectors/arrows.
    *   Ensure consistency in colors, fonts, and line styles across all diagrams, aligning with the main Architecture Diagram Specification (T3.1) where applicable.
