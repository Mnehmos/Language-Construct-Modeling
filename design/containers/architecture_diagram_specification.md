# Architecture Diagram Specification

## 1. Introduction
This document specifies the design for the main architecture diagram for the whitepaper "Integrating Structured AI Teams with Language Construct Modeling". It is based on the `core_architecture_design.md` (Section 4: Architectural Overview, Section 5: Core Components, Section 6: Key Interactions) and `draft_technical_foundation.md` (Section 4: Core Architecture).

## 2. Purpose of Diagram
To provide a clear, high-level visual overview of the integrated framework's components, their layering, and their primary interactions and data flows, illustrating how Language Construct Modeling (LCM) enhances structured AI teams.

## 3. Key Elements to Visualize
*   Semantic Layer (LCM Engine & Resources)
*   Team Definition & Configuration Layer (File System)
*   Integration & Orchestration Layer
*   Execution & Operational Layer (AI Agents)
*   Shared Knowledge Repository (LCM-based)
*   Communication Bus
*   External Interfaces (e.g., User Interface, External Tools/Data)

## 4. Diagram Style and Layout
*   **Style:** Layered block diagram.
*   **Layout:** The diagram will depict a multi-layered architecture.
    *   **Foundation Layer (Bottom):** Semantic Layer (LCM Engine & Resources).
    *   **Input/Configuration Layer (Above Foundation, feeding into Middle):** Team Definition & Configuration Layer (File System).
    *   **Central/Middle Layer:** Integration & Orchestration Layer, acting as the primary bridge and control point.
    *   **Operational Layer (Above/Driven by Middle):** Execution & Operational Layer (AI Agents).
    *   **Supporting Components (Visually connected to multiple layers as appropriate):**
        *   Shared Knowledge Repository: Positioned to show interaction with Semantic, Orchestration, and Execution Layers.
        *   Communication Bus: Illustrated as a central channel or backbone facilitating communication primarily between the Orchestration Layer and Execution Layer, and for inter-agent communication within the Execution Layer.
    *   **Periphery:** External Interfaces (User Interface, External Tools/Data) interacting primarily with the Integration & Orchestration Layer and/or Execution & Operational Layer.

## 5. Detailed Description of Visual Elements

### 5.1. Components (Blocks)
    *   **Semantic Layer (LCM Engine & Resources):** Large rectangle at the bottom. Label: "Semantic Layer (LCM Engine & Resources)". Color: Light Blue (e.g., #ADD8E6). Contains sub-text: "Ontologies, Primitives, Grammars".
    *   **Team Definition & Configuration Layer:** Rectangle above and feeding into the Integration Layer. Label: "Team Definition & Configuration Layer (File System)". Color: Light Green (e.g., #90EE90). Contains sub-text: "Personas, Team Structures, Task Definitions, Workflows, LCM Configs".
    *   **Integration & Orchestration Layer:** Prominent rectangle in the center. Label: "Integration & Orchestration Layer". Color: Light Orange (e.g., #FFDAB9). Contains sub-text: "Config Loading, Semantic Enrichment, Task Assignment, Workflow Control".
    *   **Execution & Operational Layer (AI Agents):** Rectangle above/driven by the Integration Layer. Label: "Execution & Operational Layer (AI Agents)". Color: Light Yellow (e.g., #FFFFE0). May show smaller stylized agent icons within.
    *   **Shared Knowledge Repository:** Cylinder shape, connected to Semantic, Orchestration, and Execution Layers. Label: "Shared Knowledge Repository (LCM-Indexed)". Color: Light Purple (e.g., #E6E6FA).
    *   **Communication Bus:** Thick horizontal or vertical line/channel. Label: "Communication Bus". Color: Grey (e.g., #D3D3D3).
    *   **User Interface:** Rectangle at the periphery (e.g., top-left or top-right). Label: "User Interface". Color: Light Grey (e.g., #F0F0F0).
    *   **External Tools/Data:** Rectangle at the periphery (e.g., bottom-left or bottom-right). Label: "External Tools/Data". Color: Light Grey (e.g., #F0F0F0).

### 5.2. Connections (Arrows and Lines)
    *   **Team Definition & Configuration Layer -> Integration & Orchestration Layer:** Solid arrow. Label: "Loads: Definitions, Personas, Tasks, Workflows".
    *   **Integration & Orchestration Layer <-> Semantic Layer:** Bidirectional solid arrow. Label: "Semantic Enrichment, Interpretation, Query, Generation".
    *   **Integration & Orchestration Layer -> Execution & Operational Layer (via Communication Bus for task dispatch):** Solid arrow. Label: "Task Assignments & Control".
    *   **Execution & Operational Layer -> Integration & Orchestration Layer (via Communication Bus for reporting):** Solid arrow. Label: "Status & Results".
    *   **Execution & Operational Layer (AI Agents) <-> Shared Knowledge Repository:** Bidirectional solid arrow. Label: "Knowledge Access & Contribution".
    *   **Semantic Layer <-> Shared Knowledge Repository:** Bidirectional solid arrow. Label: "Semantic Indexing & Querying".
    *   **Execution & Operational Layer (AI Agents) <-> Communication Bus:** Lines connecting individual agents (or the layer as a whole) to the bus. Label on bus connection: "Inter-Agent Messages, Task Data".
    *   **Integration & Orchestration Layer <-> Communication Bus:** Connection point. Label: "Message Routing & Monitoring".
    *   **User Interface -> Integration & Orchestration Layer:** Solid arrow. Label: "User Input & Commands".
    *   **Integration & Orchestration Layer -> User Interface:** Solid arrow. Label: "System Output & Feedback".
    *   **Execution & Operational Layer (AI Agents) <-> External Tools/Data:** Bidirectional solid arrow. Label: "Tool Invocation & Data Exchange".
    *   **(Optional) Integration & Orchestration Layer <-> External Tools/Data:** If orchestration directly manages some external tools. Bidirectional solid arrow. Label: "Direct Tool Management".

## 6. Suggested Tools and Format
*   **Suggested Tools:**
    *   draw.io (diagrams.net) - Free, web-based, versatile.
    *   Lucidchart - Web-based, collaborative, feature-rich.
    *   Microsoft Visio - Desktop application, powerful.
    *   PlantUML - For a code-based approach to diagramming, allowing version control of the diagram source.
*   **Intended Output Format:**
    *   **PNG:** For embedding in the whitepaper document (raster, good for general use).
    *   **SVG:** For scalability and web use (vector, maintains quality at any size).

## 7. Notes for Diagram Creator
*   Maintain visual clarity and avoid excessive clutter. Use whitespace effectively.
*   Use consistent font sizes, styles, and arrow types.
*   Ensure the logical flow of information (control and data) is visually apparent.
*   Colors should be chosen for good contrast and readability, including for color-blind individuals if possible (e.g., avoid red/green reliance without other cues).
*   The diagram should be professional and suitable for a technical whitepaper.
*   Emphasize the central role of the Integration & Orchestration Layer and the foundational support of the Semantic Layer.
