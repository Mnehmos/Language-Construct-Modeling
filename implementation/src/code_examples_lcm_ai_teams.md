# Documented Code Examples: Integrating LCM and AI Teams

## Introduction
This document provides illustrative code examples for key implementation patterns discussed in the whitepaper. These examples are conceptual and aim to clarify the mechanisms of integrating Language Construct Modeling (LCM) with structured AI teams.

## Example 1: Semantically Enriching Agent Persona (Pattern 1)

**Description:** This example shows how an agent's persona, defined in YAML, can reference LCM constructs, and how a Python-like orchestrator or agent loader might load and interpret this to provide richer semantic context.

**Conceptual YAML Persona File (`researcher_agent_persona.yaml`):**
```yaml
agent_id: researcher_01
role: "Primary Investigator"
description: "Specializes in advanced literature review and data synthesis."
lcm_profile_ref: "lcm://profiles/agents/research_investigator_v1.2" # Overall semantic profile for the agent

capabilities:
  - skill_id: "advanced_literature_review"
    description: "Conducts comprehensive literature reviews using academic databases and synthesizes findings."
    lcm_construct_ref: "lcm://constructs/skills/academic_search_synthesis_advanced_v2.1" # Detailed semantic definition of the skill
    parameters_schema_ref: "lcm://schemas/skills/lit_review_params_v1.lcm" # Defines expected parameters like depth, scope
    output_construct_ref: "lcm://constructs/artifacts/annotated_bibliography_v2.lcm" # Defines expected output structure
    proficiency_lcm: "lcm://levels/expert" # Semantic proficiency level

  - skill_id: "statistical_data_analysis"
    description: "Performs statistical modeling and interprets results for research purposes."

tools_access:
  - tool_id: "arxiv_mcp"
    lcm_tool_profile_ref: "lcm://tools/profiles/arxiv_mcp_v1.0"
  - tool_id: "perplexity_mcp"
    lcm_tool_profile_ref: "lcm://tools/profiles/perplexity_mcp_v1.1"

```
**Explanation:**
*   The YAML persona file (`researcher_agent_persona.yaml`) uses various `lcm_..._ref` keys (e.g., `lcm_profile_ref`, `lcm_construct_ref`, `lcm_tool_profile_ref`) to link elements of the agent's definition to specific semantic constructs within an LCM system.
*   The conceptual Python snippet demonstrates an `LcmEngine` that simulates resolving these LCM URIs to their (mocked) semantic definitions. In a real system, this engine would query a dedicated LCM repository or registry.
*   The `Agent` class, upon loading its persona, uses the `LcmEngine` to fetch these semantic definitions. This enriches the agent's understanding of its own profile, capabilities, tools, and communication preferences beyond simple string descriptions.
*   For instance, a skill like "advanced_literature_review" is not just a label; it's linked to an LCM construct (`lcm://constructs/skills/academic_search_synthesis_advanced_v2.1`) that could define its typical inputs, outputs, methods, and sub-processes in a machine-interpretable way.
*   This semantic enrichment allows the orchestration layer, other agents, or even the agent itself to reason more deeply about its functions and how they relate to tasks or other agents.

**Assumptions:**
*   An `LcmEngine` exists and is capable of resolving LCM URIs to detailed semantic constructs (definitions, schemas, profiles).
*   A well-defined LCM repository or registry stores these constructs, versioned and managed.
*   The structure of LCM constructs (e.g., for skills, profiles, tools) is predefined within the LCM system.
*   The YAML parser (like PyYAML) is available for loading the persona file.

## Example 2: LCM-Driven Task Interpretation and Decomposition (Pattern 2)

**Description:** This example illustrates how a task defined in a YAML file can be linked to an LCM construct. An `LCMEngine` then uses this construct to interpret the natural language description of the task, extract parameters, validate inputs, and potentially propose a decomposition into semantically defined sub-tasks.

**Conceptual Task Definition File (`task_market_analysis.yaml`):**
```yaml
task_id: "MT_Analysis_Q3_Electronics_NA"
title: "Q3 Consumer Electronics Market Trend Analysis - North America"
description: >
  Analyze current market trends for consumer electronics in North America for Q3 2025,
  focusing on wearable technology and smart home devices. Identify key growth drivers,
  potential risks, and emerging opportunities.

**Explanation:**
*   The task definition YAML file (`task_market_analysis.yaml`) includes an `lcm_task_construct_ref`. This reference points to a detailed semantic definition of what "Comprehensive Market Trend Analysis" entails within the LCM system.
*   The `LCMEngine` loads this specific task construct (`lcm://constructs/tasks/market_trend_analysis_comprehensive_v1.3`). This construct (mocked in the Python code) defines:
    *   `expected_parameters_lcm`: The kinds of information the task needs (e.g., market segment, region, time period).
    *   `input_schema_lcm_refs`: The semantic types of data inputs required.
    *   `output_artifact_lcm_ref`: The semantic type of the expected output.
    *   `decomposition_strategy_lcm`: A structured way this task type can be broken down into smaller, semantically defined sub-tasks (e.g., data collection, segment analysis, synthesis, reporting).
*   The `Orchestrator`, using the `LCMEngine`, performs several steps:
    1.  **Resolves** the `lcm_task_construct_ref` to get the task's semantic blueprint.
    2.  **Interprets** the natural language `description` from the YAML file against the `expected_parameters_lcm` defined in the construct. This helps extract structured, semantic parameters (e.g., inferring "North America" as the `geographical_region_lcm`).
    3.  **Validates** the `inputs` provided in the YAML against the `input_schema_lcm_refs` from the construct.
    4.  **Decomposes** the main task into a sequence of sub-tasks if the `decomposition_strategy_lcm` is present in the construct. Each generated sub-task would also have its own `lcm_subtask_construct_ref`, making the entire workflow semantically grounded.
*   This LCM-driven process allows the system to understand the task with much greater precision than just relying on the natural language description alone. It enables more accurate parameterization, better validation, and intelligent decomposition into manageable steps for AI agents.

**Assumptions:**
*   An `LCMEngine` exists with access to a repository of LCM task constructs, sub-task constructs, data type definitions, and concept definitions.
*   LCM task constructs are designed to include information about expected parameters, input/output schemas, and potentially decomposition strategies.
*   The `LCMEngine` has capabilities for natural language interpretation (to extract parameters from descriptions) and for applying decomposition logic based on the constructs.
*   An `Orchestrator` component is responsible for managing the lifecycle of tasks.

## Example 3: Semantically Grounded Inter-Agent Communication (Pattern 3)

**Description:** This example demonstrates how messages exchanged between agents can be structured according to predefined LCM communication constructs (like "speech acts"). It also shows a conceptual `SemanticChannelEqualizer` that could adapt messages if sender and receiver have different semantic profiles or preferences.

```

**Explanation:**
*   **LCM Communication Act & Payload Schemas:** The communication itself is typed using an LCM construct (`lcm://constructs/communication_acts/request_information_v1.1`). This construct defines the expected `parameters` (like urgency, response format) and can point to a separate LCM schema for the `payload` (`lcm://schemas/payloads/request_info_details_v1`). This ensures messages are structured and their intent is semantically clear.
*   **Agent Message Structure:** The JSON message on the bus includes:
    *   `lcm_communication_act_ref`: Specifies the semantic type of the message.
    *   `lcm_sender_profile_ref` & `lcm_receiver_profile_ref`: Point to the LCM profiles of the communicating agents. These profiles might indicate preferred communication styles, data formats, or query languages.
    *   `parameters`: Values for the parameters defined in the communication act schema.
    *   `payload`: The actual content of the message, structured according to its LCM payload schema.
*   **Semantic Channel Equalizer:**
    *   The `SemanticChannelEqualizer` (conceptually part of the Integration & Orchestration Layer or a gateway on the Communication Bus) intercepts messages.
    *   It uses the `LcmEngine` to load the sender's profile, receiver's profile, and the communication act's definition.
    *   The `LcmEngine.needs_equalization()` method (conceptually) checks if there's a mismatch (e.g., sender prefers natural language queries, but receiver expects a strict, structured query language like a hypothetical "LQL").
    *   If equalization is needed, `LcmEngine.transform_payload_for_receiver()` attempts to convert the payload. In the example, it (conceptually) transforms a natural language `specific_query_string` into a `structured_lql_query` format preferred by the receiver. This transformation would be guided by LCM rules and semantic parsing.
*   This pattern allows agents with potentially different internal "languages" or processing preferences to communicate effectively, with the LCM layer bridging semantic gaps.

**Assumptions:**
*   An `LcmEngine` can resolve various LCM constructs: communication acts, payload schemas, agent profiles, concepts, levels, and formats.
*   Agent profiles contain information about their communication preferences (e.g., preferred query styles, data formats).
*   LCM communication act schemas define parameters and link to payload schemas.
*   The `LcmEngine` has sophisticated capabilities to determine if equalization is needed and to perform complex transformations (e.g., NL to structured query) based on LCM definitions.
*   A `SemanticChannelEqualizer` component exists and can intercept and process messages.

```

**Explanation:**
*   **LCM Knowledge Item Schema:** The YAML file (`knowledge_item_research_finding.lcm.yaml`) defines the structure of a "research finding" knowledge item using LCM constructs.
    *   Properties like `finding_id`, `statement_text`, `source_document_lcm_ref`, and `confidence_level_lcm_ref` are themselves typed or linked to LCM concepts or constructs (e.g., `lcm://concepts/ids/unique_identifier_v1`).
    *   Crucially, `statement_text` includes `lcm_meaning_extraction_rules`. These rules instruct the `LCMEngine` on how to parse this natural language field to extract semantic information (e.g., key entities based on an ontology, relationships like causality or correlation).
    *   Fields like `extracted_entities_lcm` and `identified_relations_lcm` are intended to be automatically populated by the LCM engine during the indexing process.
*   **SKRService - Adding Knowledge:**
    *   When an agent contributes new knowledge (e.g., `new_finding_data_from_agent`), the `SKRService.add_knowledge_item` method is called.
    *   It resolves the provided `schema_uri` using the `LCMEngine` to get the semantic blueprint for this type of knowledge.
    *   The `LCMEngine.extract_semantic_metadata` method is invoked, using the `lcm_meaning_extraction_rules` from the schema to process the `statement_text`. This populates fields like `extracted_entities_lcm`.
    *   The augmented item (original data + extracted semantic metadata) is then stored in the database. This ensures knowledge is semantically indexed upon contribution.
*   **SKRService - Querying Knowledge:**
    *   When an agent queries the SKR (either with natural language or a structured LCM-based query), `SKRService.query_knowledge` is used.
    *   `LCMEngine.interpret_skr_query` converts the input query into a structured semantic representation, potentially using the querying agent's profile for context.
    *   `LCMEngine.translate_to_db_query` then translates this semantic representation into a query understandable by the underlying database (e.g., SPARQL for a graph DB, or a complex NoSQL query leveraging the semantic tags).
    *   The results from the database can be further refined or ranked by the LCM engine if needed.
*   This pattern allows for much richer interaction with the SKR. Contributions are automatically processed for deeper meaning, and queries can be more nuanced and context-aware, going beyond simple keyword searches.

**Assumptions:**
*   An `LCMEngine` exists with capabilities for schema resolution, semantic metadata extraction (based on rules in schemas), query interpretation (NL and structured), and translation to DB-specific queries.
*   A repository of LCM schemas for different knowledge item types is maintained.
*   The underlying database (mocked here as `MockDatabaseInterface`) supports storing and querying potentially complex, semantically tagged data.
*   LCM ontologies, relation constructs, and concept definitions are available for the `LCMEngine` to use during extraction and interpretation.

## Example 5: Dynamic Workflow Orchestration with Semantic Awareness (Pattern 5)

**Description:** This example illustrates how a file-based workflow script can be enhanced with LCM references. An `Orchestrator` uses an `LCMEngine` to understand semantic dependencies between tasks, make context-aware decisions at branching points, and validate workflow progress against a semantically defined goal.

**Explanation:**
*   **File-Defined Workflow with LCM Hooks:** The YAML workflow (`workflow_product_launch.yaml`) defines a sequence of `tasks`.
    *   It has an overall `lcm_workflow_goal_ref` to semantically define the workflow's objective.
    *   Each `task_id` links to a task definition (assumed to be detailed elsewhere or embedded) which itself has an `lcm_task_construct_ref` (as in Pattern 2).
    *   `depends_on_lcm_outputs`: This key specifies semantic dependencies. For example, `product_development_sprint1` requires an output of type `lcm://constructs/artifacts/market_feasibility_report_validated_v1.0` from the `market_research_feasibility_phase` task. The Orchestrator uses the LCM Engine to verify if such an artifact (semantically typed) exists in the SKR, linked to the source task.
    *   `next_tasks` can include `condition_lcm_ref`. These point to LCM constructs that define conditions (e.g., `lcm://constructs/conditions/positive_market_feasibility_confirmed_v1`).
*   **Orchestrator with Semantic Awareness:**
    *   The `Orchestrator` loads the workflow definition.
    *   **Semantic Dependency Check:** Before executing a task, it uses `LCMEngine.is_dependency_satisfied()` to check if the required semantic inputs (as defined in `depends_on_lcm_outputs`) are available (e.g., by querying the SKR for artifacts of the correct semantic type from the correct source task).
    *   **Task Execution:** It calls a `TaskExecutor` to run the task. The result (an artifact) would ideally be stored in the SKR with its semantic type.
    *   **Context-Aware Path Selection:** At decision points (where `next_tasks` has conditions), the `Orchestrator` uses `LCMEngine.evaluate_condition()`. This method takes the `condition_lcm_ref` and the current context (e.g., results from the last task, relevant data from SKR) to semantically evaluate which condition is met and thus which path to take in the workflow.
*   This pattern allows the Orchestrator to go beyond simple linear execution. It can understand *why* tasks depend on each other (based on semantic types of inputs/outputs) and make more intelligent, context-sensitive decisions about workflow progression based on the semantic meaning of conditions and the current state of affairs.

**Assumptions:**
*   An `LCMEngine` can resolve LCM constructs for workflow goals, task definitions, conditions, and artifact types.
*   Task definitions (referenced by `task_id`) are available and include `lcm_task_construct_ref` and definitions of their semantic output types.
*   LCM condition constructs (`condition_lcm_ref`) define evaluation logic that the `LCMEngine` can interpret against a given context (e.g., by checking properties of artifacts in an SKR).
*   A Shared Knowledge Repository (SKR) interface is available for checking if required input artifacts (dependencies) exist and for storing output artifacts of tasks.
*   A `TaskExecutor` component is responsible for the actual execution of individual tasks (which might itself use Pattern 2 for LCM-driven interpretation).
